For Mac M1, download the bash script to download
>wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh
>bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh

Once you installed Miniconda, it'll ask you if you want to activate it as default upon startup, yes.  Then restart terminal.  You'll have python 3.12.7 installed with the base conda
>python
>Python 3.12.7 | packaged by Anaconda, Inc.....

So you're good to go.  Just use this environment for AIResearch.

A few useful conda commands:
>conda deactivate
>conda update --all
>conda create -n "researcher" python-3.11

Here's where you can download the python 3.12.3
>wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.3/python-3.12.3-macos11.pkg
