For Mac M1, download the bash script to download
>wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh
>bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh

Once you installed Miniconda, it'll ask you if you want to activate it as default upon startup, yes.  Then restart terminal.  You'll have python 3.12.7 installed with the base conda
>python
>Python 3.12.7 | packaged by Anaconda, Inc.....

So you're good to go.  Now create researcher env
>conda create -n "researcher" python=3.12

Get the source code
>git clone https://github.com/NobShen/AIResearcher.git

Now cd into AIResearcher directory and create a few more directories:
>cd AIResearcher
>mkdir chroma
>mkdir sourceDocs
>mkdir archive
>mkdir obsidianVault

Now update config_default.py:

```DB_PATH = "/Users/jason/AIResearcher/chroma"
```GOOGLE_API_KEY = 'AIza......'
```MODEL_NAME = 'gemini-1.5-pro'
```CONVERSATION_FILE = '/Users/jason/AIResearcher/user/obsidianVault/AIResearch.md'

And update importall.py to reflect new directory structure:
```document_directory = "/Users/jason/AIResearcher/sourceDocs"

A few useful conda commands:
>conda deactivate
>conda update --all

Here's where you can download the python 3.12.3 if needed:
>wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.3/python-3.12.3-macos11.pkg
